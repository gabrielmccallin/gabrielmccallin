## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel McCallin

I am curious, brave and determined. I try to understand people, I try to learn every day.

I love leading cross-functional teams, helping them adopt modern software practices, a strong product-driven mindset and a focus on usability and customer value.

I have worked with enterprises and startups, public and private sector, distributed and co-located teams, always looking to build a collaborative and agile culture.
